    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir in water until a slightly sticky dough forms. Set aside to rest while oil preheats.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a round disc the size of your palm.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Fry dough discs, one at a time, in hot oil until bottoms are browned, about 2 minutes; flip with tongs and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Drain fry bread on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <p>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in kidney beans and chili seasoning; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <p>Place each fry bread on a plate; top each with a portion of chili mixture, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.</p>
